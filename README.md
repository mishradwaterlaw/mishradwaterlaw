## About Me

I'm currently exploring programming, data analysis, and web development. I'm not an expert at anything particular just curious and consistent. I document what I learn through small projects and experiments on GitHub OR insta.

## Featured Projects

> I keep things simple and open source. Most of what I do is public so I can track progress.. PS- i post stories on insta for things i make but they never make it to my github (publically hehe), cuz i think of them as not good enough, even my titanic project is private now...You're gonna have to trust me that i made that project and someday i might make it oublic as a full on ML project.

[Titanic Dataset Exploration](https://github.com/mishradwaterlaw/titanicdatasetfirst-application) – basic data exploration using Pandas & Matplotlib

More coming soon...
