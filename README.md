## About Me

I'm a first-year Information Science student based in Mysuru. I'm currently exploring full-stack engineering, real-time systems, and data analysis. I'm not an expert—just curious, consistent, and building things that solve real problems. I document my journey through projects here on GitHub and share the "behind the scenes" on Instagram.

## What I'm Working On

- **Real-Time Systems**: Building apps with WebRTC and sub-second data syncing.
- **DSA in C++**: Strengthening problem-solving foundations for technical interviews.
- **Full-Stack Development**: Exploring the intersection of Next.js and reactive backends.
- **Open Source**: Preparing for programs like GSoC and LFX Mentorship.

## Featured Projects

### 🚀 [SynIntView](https://github.com/your-username/SynIntView)
A professional-grade Technical Interview Platform. This isn't just a "UI project"—it's a full-on feature implementation focusing on real-time engineering:
- **WebRTC Video**: Multi-layout video conferencing with automated theater mode for screen sharing.
- **Collaborative Editor**: A live-syncing Monaco editor for real-time coding assessments.
- **Reactive Backend**: Powered by Convex for instant note-taking and state persistence.
- **Auth & Security**: Secure GitHub OAuth integration via Auth.js.

### 📊 [Titanic Dataset Exploration](https://github.com/mishradwaterlaw/titanicdatasetfirst-application)
Basic data exploration using Pandas & Matplotlib. (Currently refining my ML skills to make this a full predictive model soon!)

> I keep things simple and open source. Most of what I do is public so I can track progress. PS- I post stories on Insta for things I make but they don't always make it to GitHub immediately because I'm a bit of a perfectionist (hehe). You're gonna have to trust me—the progress is real!
